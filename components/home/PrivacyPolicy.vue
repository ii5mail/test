                ConstructionBevy mission is to help professionals discover the value of their relationships every day.<br /><br />
                In order to achieve that mission, information security and our customers’ privacy are values on which we do not compromise. ConstructionBevy was built on the idea that our relationships are the most valuable asset we have. We want to protect them, and be their gatekeeper, but also maximize their value. Our unique service matches two members based on their preferences, thus providing the opportunity to connect professionals with others they’ll want to network with.</p>
            <h3 class="medium-font medium-weight mb-6">Scope of This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="font-18 mb-12">
                ConstructionBevy (“ConstructionBevy,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) values the privacy of individuals who use our application, websites, and related services (collectively, the “ConstructionBevy Service”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information from ConstructionBevy users (“Users”). Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of ConstructionBevy is also subject to our Terms of Service (constructionbevy.com/terms).
            </p>
            <h3 class="medium-font medium-weight mb-6">Cookies & Information We Collect</h3>
            <p class="font-18 mb-12">
                A. Information You Provide to Us<br /><br />
                Registration Information. When you sign up for a ConstructionBevy account, you give us your name, optional picture, and email address. You can also add a tagline describing yourself and what industry or industries you are a part of.<br /><br />
                User Profile Information. When you join the ConstructionBevy community, you create a ConstructionBevy Profile and a Wish List to network with other members who can help you with important introductions. Completing your Profile and Wish List are optional, and you can share as little or as much about yourself as you want. Before you reach out to another member, or they reach out to you, and before you accept a Networking Request, only your first name and last initial are shared along with your tagline and the city and state where you live. Full names are not revealed until you send a request or you can see the other member when they accept your request. Only after a networking request is received, or accepted, can a user see mutual contacts. Only mutual contacts are visible to the other user, not your entire address book, and then only the first and last name of the mutual contact, as each user stores them in their device, is displayed. You also have a Private Profile section in your account, which is shared with the other User you are communicating with when you initiate or accept a Networking Request. This ensures you are a real person and allows them to ask mutual friends about your trustworthiness. Once a networking request has been accepted, both users may initiate a chat within the app.<br /><br />
                Payment Method. The application is free for now and there is no payment mechanism.<br /><br />
                Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email address, possibly your phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.<br /><br />
                B. Information We Collect When You Use the NiceLeads Service<br /><br />
                Location Information. ConstructionBevy is all about connecting Users who can help one another network. To do this, we may need to know where you are, in which case when you open NiceLeads on your mobile device, we will know your location. We may also collect the precise location of your device whenever the app is running in the foreground or background.<br /><br />
                Device Information. ConstructionBevy receives information from Users’ devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. We also may collect mobile sensor data from Users’ devices (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration or deceleration) to improve location accuracy and analyze use patterns.<br /><br />
                Use Information.

                Call and Text Information. We may work with a third-party partner to facilitate messages between Users. Among the information we may receive about these communications is the date and time of the chat and the content of any message.<br /><br />

You may request to delete your account at any time and we do not reach out to your contacts unless you initiate it, or we are compelled by a court order.<br /><br />
